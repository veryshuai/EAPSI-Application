\begin{document}

\maketitle
I, David Jinkins, have read the RCR implementation section in the GPG, the RCR implementation section in the AAG, RCR Frequently asked questions, and the NSF page on International Research Integrity.  In addition I skimmed the Australian Code for Responsible Conduct for Research linked to on the EAPSI website, reading the sections relevant to my situation.  At Penn State, I completed my Scholarship and Research Integrity requirement with an online course provided by the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative program in 2009.\\
