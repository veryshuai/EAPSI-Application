\maketitle

I am an American Citizen.  I attended Sturgeon Bay High School in Sturgeon Bay, WI.  I have never received an EAPSI fellowship.  
\section{Academic Background}
I have a 2005 BA in Political Science from Carleton College in Northfield, MN.  While at Carleton, I spent one semester directly enrolled in the International Relations Department of Peking University, and one summer I received a Chang-Lan Fellowship to interview unemployed workers in Manchuria.  In 2006 I received a Fulbright Fellowship to study Chinese migrants in Istanbul.  My host was Ahmed Icduygu of Koc University.  From 2007 to 2009, I was enrolled in the Economics masters program of National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan.  My thesis advisor was Professor Hung-Ju Chen.  The thesis was a simple model of return migration governed by bounded rationality.  My studies in Taiwan were financed by a Taiwan Scholarship from the Taiwanese Ministry of Education.  Since 2009 I have been enrolled in the Economics PHD program of Penn State University.  I passed my qualification exams in the summer of 2010.  My second year empirical methods project estimated the marginal effect of an additional migrant on the level of bilateral trade between two countries.  My first two years at Penn State were funded by a departmental fellowship, and I am currently a research assistant for Professors Jonathan Eaton and Jim Tybout.           

\section{Research Experience}
While in Taiwan, I was a research assistant for Assistant Professor Chun-Fang Chiang.  The project I worked on involved estimating learning behavior in hospital visits during the SARS epidemic.  We had access to an individual-level dataset recording visits to hospitals, doctors and procedure done, medicine prescribed, etc.  This data was compiled from the Taiwanese national health care system, and the data set was huge.  I wrote STATA do files for this project, as well as counting newspaper articles mentioning SARS in various Taiwanese newspapers.

I am currently working as a research assistant on another learning project, but this time using Colombian transactions-level trade data.  The basic idea is to model the matching process between Colombian exporters and American clients, and to model the way in which Colombian exporters learn about American demand for their products as the number of clients they have met increases.  Since I started working on this project, the model has changed from discrete to continuous time.  I have rewritten much of the original MATLAB estimation code to reflect this change.  I have also implemented version control to track all of the program changes made, and introduced parallel processing into the code.

\section{International Experience}
I have lived in China (and Taiwan) for a cumulative total of four years and I lived in Turkey for one year.  I can speak, read, and type in both Turkish and Chinese.  Since most of my time abroad was in academic environments, I am comfortable doing research in foreign countries.  I have a fair amount of experience navigating bureaucracy in Turkey and China (and the United States).  I should also mention that I really enjoy living abroad.

\section{Other Experience and Skills}
After graduating from college, I worked at an international freight forwarder in New York for a year.  It was a small company, so I was responsible for everything from calculating and sending out quotes to coordinating shipments and actually preparing bills of lading and letters of credit.  Some of the more interesting items I shipped were used school busses to West Africa and replacement parts for power plants in South Asia.  Although I was not at the company long, I learned a lot about how different kinds of items are packed into containers, how shipping lines work, and the meaning of shipping terms like CIS and FOB.

I like writing code for computers, and I am comfortable using MATLAB, STATA, Mathematica, and git.  I can code in latex and html and I know some css.
