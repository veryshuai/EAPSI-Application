\maketitle

My project will not generate new data, but I will be analyzing existing data.  The Heffetz survey data and replication files will soon be available on the \emph{Review of Economics and Statistics} website.  Depending on what becomes available as the project moves forward, the budget survey data I use may be confidential. If the data is publicly available, I will explain how to acquire the data from public sources in my final write-up.  If the data is not publicly available, I will provide a detailed description of how I accessed to the data, and how other researchers might access this data in the future.  All of my estimation code files will be open-source.  I usually share my code on the website github.com, which allows other researchers to download and modify all code files.
